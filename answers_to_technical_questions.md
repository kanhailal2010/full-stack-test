<ul>
  <li>I spent around 6hrs. I could have done it in less time but I took more time to make the CRUD user friendly(I got carried away building this tiny , I love challenges and building this ). I would have spent more time on implementing a better UX and proper REST approach for the APIs. I would have followed the styleguide you provided. </li>
  <li>How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?</li>
  <li>For frontend performance issues, I generally use Google PageSpeed Insights to check the website performance. Perfomance can be improved mostly by removing unused CSS and JS. Optimizing images size. Minifying CSS and JS. Caching data. </li>
  <li>Backend performance issues can be fixed by caching data, Code and SQL Optimization. The last resort will be moving to a more faster server. </li>
  <li>Please describe yourself using JSON.</li>
